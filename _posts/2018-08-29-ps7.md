Before you dive into this book, you should have a solid working proficiency over JavaScript up to the most recent standard (at the time of this writing), which is commonly called ES5 (technically ES 5.1). Here, we plan to talk squarely about the upcoming ES6, as well as cast our vision beyond to understand how JS will evolve moving forward.

If you are still looking for confidence with JavaScript, I highly recommend you read the other titles in this series first:

Up & Going: Are you new to programming and JS? This is the roadmap you need to consult as you start your learning journey.

- Up & Going
- Scope & Closures
- this & Object Prototypes
- Types & Grammar
- Async & Performance
